# Stock-Market-Analysis-and-Prediction-using-ML
The project's goal is to employ a Markov Model with three iterations of stock prices to forecast future stock values using previous returns. We have gathered various datasets from various companies over the last 5 years. We used the XAMPP server, which included Apache and MySQL services, to connect the database to the web application. The web pages were created using HTML, CSS, and PHP. The web application predicts the price of a certain stock and indicates if it is a good investment after using the following tools. The web application displays the opening and closing prices of various stocks. A predicted outcome and a real-time result are compared based on previous data to determine their accuracy. As a result, we know how accurate we can predict, allowing the consumer to invest. The user gets a hazy to vivid idea of how much the market might fall or climb, allowing them to decide whether to purchase or sell.

We have followed the below flow of work to reach our end goal.

Software explaiation and implemtation can be found both in the paper published and the repository. Below are the expected results of the working project. We have Taken dataset of few companies from secure database website. And Other two are for saving internal required data.

We were able to predict the opening and closing price prediction of each company with almost between 90% to 96%. I have added the opening and closing price predictions of Google for reference.

Opening Price prediction of Google

Closing Price prediction of Google

The prediction page has two other option of recommendation and accuracy. Accuracy shows how accurate the prediction was on the previous data that we had entered in the database. When we click on the accuracy button inside Google prediction, we see that:

The accuracy for GOOGLE stocks is

After a detailed analysis, the application recommends if its investing is the right choice. This is an example of Google Stocks.

But we can notice that it is safe to invest in Microsoft from the below observations.

And this is what it recommends

At the end I wouuld like to add that, There is a lot of room for improvement in our project in the future. When used in combination with the Markov model, the Hidden Markov model can increase accuracy. If we want to go ahead with our project, we should base our estimates on deciles rather than quartiles (i.e.,10 intervals instead of 4) Although no definitive statement can be made about any forecast, it tends to be gathered that the field of prediction based on such mathematical models has a lot of potential. Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence has created different techniques like Sentiment analysis, Neural networks and Fundamental analysis. These approaches help make predictions associated with markets remarkably faster. Sentiment analysis, neural networks, and fundamental analysis are some of the techniques developed by Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. These methods aid in making business forecasts in a remarkably short amount of time.

I am very thank full of Mr. Yerriswamy T for his support and guidance throughout the project on the topic Stock Market Analysis and Prediction. And to my fellow mates.
