# Stock-Market-Analysis-and-Prediction-using-ML
The project's goal is to employ a Markov Model with three iterations of stock prices to forecast future stock values using previous returns. We have gathered various datasets from various companies over the last 5 years. We used the XAMPP server, which included Apache and MySQL services, to connect the database to the web application. The web pages were created using HTML, CSS, and PHP. The web application predicts the price of a certain stock and indicates if it is a good investment after using the following tools. The web application displays the opening and closing prices of various stocks. A predicted outcome and a real-time result are compared based on previous data to determine their accuracy. As a result, we know how accurate we can predict, allowing the consumer to invest. The user gets a hazy to vivid idea of how much the market might fall or climb, allowing them to decide whether to purchase or sell.
